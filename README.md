# WDI\_PROJECT\_4: team:up (Group Project)

##Overview
The objective of this project was to work as a group to build an authenticated application of our own design, using a MEAN Stack. 

As a group, we brainstormed a number of initial ideas. As the list was 15 projects long, we had to mindmap each idea to work out which we could build into an app. From this narrowed-down list, we were able to pick an idea that we would be able to build, within a week, as a group.

The idea we selected was based on the growing need Freelancers have to build their teams, when assigned projects by a client - quite often a project will need a number of different roles to collaborate to complete. And so the app we decided to build would be centred around custom team building, including allowing users to apply for a project.

The application can be found here

##Planning
There were 2 apsects to the planning process: one centred around the User Story and how we wanted the application to work. The other point to consider was around how we worked as a group (task allocation etc). Logically, it made sense to refine the user story before we built the application - so we stepped through the user process multiple times until we were able to psuedo code how the application would work. From this we were also able to deduce which models required and the RESTful endpoints for each. Once we had defined this, it was clear what our MVP would be. Our next focus was wireframing (in HTML) the front-end views: picking a framework and style to display the information require. Once all this was in place, we we ready to start building the application.

As a group, we decided to have 2-3 standups a day and also merge/pull source code as often as we could. The plan for each day was decided in the morning standup, based on the previous day's progress. Below is our daily tasklist:
* Monday PM - Using the HTML wireframes, for each end state, the controller is to be built
* Tuesday AM - Review yesterday's progress and complete any outstanding controllers (as some were more logic-heavy than others).
* Tuesday PM,  Wednesday AM - Walkthrough of the user story to determine where fixes are required 
* Wednesday PM - Start styling the pages so they feel like an application (focus on continuity)
* Thursday AM, Thursday PM - Complete styling. Walkthrough of the user story to determine where fixes are required 
* Friday - Presentation & Demo

##Successes
Stripping back the feature list to determine an MVP, which were able to build well in the allocated time was a huge win for us as a team as it meant we had allocated tasks well. Understanding people's strengths and desires when assigning tasks was vital to ensuring that a quality app was built.

##Challenges
The biggest challenge we faced was technical strategy. Even once the user story had been defined and the pseudo code was written, working out how best to write the code - which data structures to use etc.
